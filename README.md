Well, what is eagle? Eagle is a simple, fast, and fun CLI-based application which functions as a helper to find answers to your programming questions.

Eagle works by searching your questions in Stack Overflow, and allowing you a plethora of options to get your answer to you as quick as possible.

This project was created with the intention of learning the language in more depth.

Takeaways:
- Got to know 'Cobra' in more detail, and I wasn't too much of a fan due to the overwhelming out-of-the-box functionality. Might try other libraries in the future.
- Though the script was very limited in it's scope got to understand net/http as well as enconding/json better.
- TBD
